__label__interaction interaction: the degree of influence that one player's actions have on the actions of the other participants.
__label__bash_leader bash the leader: when, to prevent the victory of whoever is first, the players are forced to take actions against him, often to the detriment of their own advantage or in any case without gaining anything directly. At the table, the unfortunate situation can arise whereby one or more must sacrifice themselves to curb the leader and let the others benefit from this conduct.
__label__complicated_vs_complex complicated vs complex: A game is complicated the more rules have too exceptions. Once you understand and learn all the variables, a game complicated is not difficult to master: solving a problem leads to immediate, certain and predictable results, challenging. A game is as complex as the repercussions of one's actions are difficult to predict a complex game is still difficult to master.
